In this project, an ASP.NET Core Empty application was structured following the MVC design pattern. The following elements were implemented:

1. Created 'Controllers', 'Models', 'Views', and 'wwwroot' folders to organize the application.
2. Configured the 'Program.cs' file to:
    - Enable MVC services using `builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews()`.
    - Configure routing for the application with `app.MapControllerRoute()`.
    - Set up a default route pointing to the 'HomeController' and its 'Index' action.
    - Prepare the app with `builder.Build()` and start the server with `app.Run()`.

Static file handling is yet to be configured for the 'wwwroot' folder.
